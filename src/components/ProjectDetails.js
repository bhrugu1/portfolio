    title: 'Sales Performance Dashboard',
    description: `The Sales Performance Dashboard is an interactive and visually-driven analytics solution built in Power BI, designed for a fictional supermarket business to analyze and monitor sales and profit performance across multiple dimensions. It leverages DAX formulas and Excel-based data modeling to present real-time insights into key sales metrics.

The dashboard highlights total sales, total profit, and profit percentage at a glance, followed by detailed visual breakdowns including:
- Monthly performance comparison of sales and profit
- Top-selling products and their contribution to revenue
- Sales distribution by type (Online, Wholesale, Direct)
- Payment method breakdown
- Daily sales trend analysis

It features fully interactive slicers for year, month, sale type, and payment mode, allowing end users to filter and drill into the data instantly. Designed with a clean dark theme and clear KPIs, the dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify sales trends, product performance, and operational focus areas.

This project demonstrates skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard storytelling, making it ideal for business users looking to make data-informed decisions.`,
